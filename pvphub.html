        <p>Former PvPHub Executive & Partner Manager</p>
        <p>PvPHub was my number one project. I am no longer with PvPHub because of my bad choices. I am a beliver in improvement. I have sufficently improved since I have been released from the project. I deeply regret my actions as PvPHub was my pride. I am not sad that it is over, but I am happy that Martin & MattMX gave me a chance that I should have never gotten.</p>
